This is a small library of code-pieces that I find useful when writing tests.

It covers areas that I miss in JUnit itself e.g. for verifying compare()/hashCode()/equals() implementations and for multi-threaded tests.

## Contents
 
* MockSMTPServer - simulate an SMTP Server for testing code which sends emails
* MockRESTServer - simulate a HTTP Server for testing code which accesses other systems, e.g. to mock REST interfaces in tests
* TestHelpers - small utilities for testing things like equals(), hashCode(), toString(), compare() and implementations of Comparator, they ensure some things that the Java spec mandates
* ThreadTestHelpers - easily run unit tests multiple times in parallel to ensure the code does not contain hidden race conditions
* MemoryLeakVerifier - a simple way of adding memory leak assertions to unit tests
* TestEnvironment - handling temporary files/directories in a clean way, ensure that files are not locked any more at the end of the test
* PrivateConstructorCoverage - use this if you would like to get 100% coverage of classes with private constructors
* HeapDump - trigger a writing a .hprof file

## Use it

### Gradle

    compile 'org.dstadler:commons-test:1.+'

## Change it

### Grab it

    git clone https://github.com/centic9/commons-test.git

### Build it and run tests

    cd commons-test
    ./gradlew check jacocoTestReport

### Release it

Check version in `gradle.properties`

    ./gradlew --console=plain https://github.com/SgtSilvio/gradle-maven-central-publishing

* This should automatically release the new version on MavenCentral
* Apply tag in Github
* Increase version in `gradle.properties` afterwards
* Afterwards go to the [Github releases page](https://github.com/centic9/commons-test/releases) and add release-notes
